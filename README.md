# Crime Prevention and Crowd Management System

## Overview

This project aims to enhance public safety and streamline crowd management using advanced computer vision techniques. The system integrates several technologies to achieve the following objectives:

1. **Criminal Face Identification**:
   - Utilizes face recognition technology to identify known criminals from a database.
   - Employs deep learning models to ensure high accuracy and reliability in various environments.

2. **Weapon Detection**:
   - Implements YOLOv3 and YOLOv8 models to detect weapons in real-time.
   - Capable of identifying various types of weapons with high precision, aiding in quick response to potential threats.

3. **Crowd Management**:
   - Uses OpenCV to count the number of heads in a given area.
   - Helps in monitoring crowd density and managing crowd control effectively.

## Prerequisites
-Create a images folder and add Person names in it

-add volov3 weights to it.


## Key Technologies

- **Face Recognition**:
  - Advanced algorithms to match faces against a database of known offenders.
  - Real-time identification to prevent crime proactively.

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once) Models**:
  - YOLOv3 and YOLOv8 for robust and fast weapon detection.
  - Suitable for real-time applications with high accuracy and speed.

- **OpenCV for Head Counting**:
  - Efficient head counting to monitor crowd density.
  - Assists in maintaining order and safety in crowded places.

## Applications

- **Law Enforcement**: Enhances the ability of law enforcement agencies to identify and apprehend criminals.
- **Event Management**: Ensures safety by monitoring and controlling crowd density at large events.
- **Public Safety**: Proactively prevents potential threats by detecting weapons and identifying suspects.

## Conclusion

This project leverages state-of-the-art computer vision technologies to create a comprehensive system for crime prevention and crowd management. By integrating face recognition, weapon detection, and head counting, it provides a powerful tool to enhance security and maintain public order.
